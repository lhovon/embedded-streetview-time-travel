# Streetview JS API Time Travel

Proof of concept implementation of a time travel feature in an embedded Streetview container.

Note: This requires a [Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup) (there's a $200/month free credit). 

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your key :)

## Features

- Switching between the available time periods at a location.
- Maintaining the selected time period (or the closest available one) while moving around using the links.
- Maintaining the selected time period (or the closest available one) after moving the Pegman, which is not supported in the real google maps!
